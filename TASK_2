Synchronous Reset Flip-Flop

Implement a simple simulation of a D flip-flop with synchronous reset in C. 
The flip-flop should have inputs for data (D), clock (CLK), and reset, and should output the current state (Q).

Develop a library that incoorporates the necessary functions or classes to perform essential calculations required by users. 
Also submit a document file about the things you learned while doing the task( be it mathematics, logic or even code syntax ).

Documentation is mandatory regardless of whether the task is completed.If the task is not completed, provide a detailed explanation of the technical 
reasons or challenges that prevented its completion.
